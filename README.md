# Cleaning Rooms Simulation

### About
A simulation of cleaner robot agents that check if the rooms are uncleaned and clean them.

### Anaylsis 
A major quantity of machine robots can improve the performance of the simualtion as well as a major quantity of steps, factors
than can affect the performance is having a parameter of less time (steps), an expansive grid and the percentage of rooms that are uncleaned since 
it requires a major number of movements from the cleaner agents to clean all the rooms.

### Simulation
The simulation receives parameters such as
- Rooms uncleaned: Percentage of rooms uncleaned
- Cleaners: Machine cleaners   
- Length:  Length of the grid
- Height: Height of the grid
- steps: Max steps

If the values of cleaners and steps are high the performance may be great, is important to consider also that if the parameters
**rooms uncleaned, cleaners, length and height** are high the performance may not be the the finest.
