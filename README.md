# Cleaning Rooms Simulation

### About
A simulation of cleaner robot agents that check if the rooms are uncleaned and clean them.

### Anaylsis 
A major quantity of machine robots can improve the performance of the simualtion as well as a major quantity of steps, factors
than can affect the performance is having a parameter of less time (steps), an expansive grid and the percentage of rooms that are uncleaned since 
it requires a major number of movements from the cleaner agents to clean all the rooms.
